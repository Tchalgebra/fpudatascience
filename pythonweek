Put your name and a brief reflection on what you think of Github! 
Brandon: Github can be confusing but I love how it keeps track of changes! 
This is during the live class! 
Chris Brownell, I see this as a giant mysterious place where the druid gods of the internet reside.
Harlan Elrich:  I have read the Dan Meyer article and done the Python coding exercises.  I think Github is a very useful tool.  I can see how coders would like it,
                as it seems that it would be very useful for people who are working on similar tasks somewhere around the world.  It is similar to a Google Doc
                in the sense that people can edit each others work.  I really enjoyed playing with the Python codes and changing things in them.  However, I would
                really like to be able to understand the code better.  There were many times when I would click run on one of the programs and it would say that 
                there was an error, but I could not even understand the error message, let alone try to fix what ever was wrong with it.  That is the really
                frustrating part of this.  If there was actually a way to write lesson plans on here, I could see how I would be able to partner with a colleague
                and construct lesson plans together.  That would be different than what Dan Meyer was talking about.  If we construct the lesson plan together,
                then we are not using someone else's lesson plan, we are using our own, but it is being used by all of us that were instrumental in creating it.
                So, I definitely see an area where this would be useful, but I think it would take a long time to learn how to code in it to be able to understand
                all of it.
